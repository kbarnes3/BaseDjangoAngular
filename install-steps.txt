To start a new site:

1. Create an emtpy Git repo and copy the contents of this repo into it (excluding this file, README.md, and possibly LICENSE.TXT).
2. Next replace all references with the placeholder site name with your site name. This can be done automatically:
    a. Ensure Python 2.7.11 is installed from https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-2711/.
    b. In the root run 'python replacer.py _variable_ "_title_" _domain_'.
        _variable_ should be only lower case characters
        _title_ should be human readable and can contain spaces, symbols, and mixed case
        _domain_ should be the domain without 'www', e.g. "example.org"
    c. Delete replacer.py.
3. Commit the all the files to Git.
4. Follow the instructions in setup-dev.txt to set up a local development environment.
5. Follow the instructions in setup-server.txt to set up a server deployment.
