To set up a newdjangosite server from a fresh Ubuntu Server 12.04 LTS installation:

1. Run 'sudo apt-get update'
2. Run 'sudo apt-get upgrade'
3. Install any held back updates using 'sudo aptitude'
4. Install the OpenSSH server using 'sudo apt-get install openssh-server'
5. Run 'ssh-keygen -C _email_' and register ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub with GitHub
6. In the /web directory in a local dev environment, run 'fab setup_server'
7. When prompted for a host string, enter one in the form of '_user_@_host_'
8. When prompted to "enter password for new role", enter a password to remotely access PostgreSQL

To set up a new deployment on a properly configured (see above) newdjangosite server:
1. Consider updating the username and password found in /web/newdjangosite/settings__deployment_.py and committing/pushing it. Note that the Fabric script won't work with passwords containing shell escape characters.
2. In the /web directory in a local dev environment, run 'fab setup_deployment:_deployment_,"_git@github.com:user/repo.git_"'
3. When prompted for a host string, enter one in the form of '_user_@_host_'
4. When prompted for a primary email and subsequent fields, enter the information for the Django superuser to create
