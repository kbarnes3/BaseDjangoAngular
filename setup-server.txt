To set up a NewDjangoSite server from a fresh Ubuntu Server 16.04 LTS installation:

1. Run 'sudo apt-get update'
2. Run 'sudo apt-get dist-upgrade'
3. Run 'sudo reboot'
4. Install the OpenSSH server using 'sudo apt-get install openssh-server'
5. Set up a local dev environment following setup-dev.txt and open a console with the venv activated. Use this console
   for the following steps.
6. From the /web directory, run 'fab setup_user:$linux_user$', where $linux_user$ is either an existing or new linux
   account that will be able to deploy to this server
7. When prompted for a host string, enter one in the form of '$user$@$host$' where $user$ is an existing sudo user,
   likely configured during the Ubuntu installation and $host$ is the IP address of your server, or something that
   resolves to it. After the initial setup, it should be possible to refer to the hostname from /etc/hostname as well
   via WINS resolution
8. Run 'fab setup_server' or 'fab setup_server:setup_wins=True' depending on whether WINS name resolution is needed. When in doubt, omit setup_wins.
9. When prompted, make sure you log in as the user you setup with 'fab setup_user'
10. Optionally, run 'fab setup_user:$linux_user$' again to grant access to others

To set up a new deployment on a properly configured (see above) NewDjangoSite server:
1. Consider updating the username and password found in /web/kitties/settings_$deployment$.py and committing/pushing it.
   Note that the Fabric script won't work with passwords containing shell escape characters.
2. Run 'auth' and follow the prompts in the browser, logging in with an account that can set deploy keys on this repo
3. In the /web directory in a local dev environment, run 'fab setup_deployment:$deployment$'
3. When prompted for a host string, enter one in the form of '$user$@$host$'
4. When prompted for a passphrase after seeing "Generating public/private rsa key pair",
   an empty passphrase is recommended
5. When prompted for a primary email and subsequent fields, enter the information for the Django superuser to create
6. To deploy changes in the future, after committing/pushing run 'fab deploy:$deployment$'
7. Optionally, run 'auth delete' to remove your local GitHub authorization token
8. If this is the first deployment on a server, consider updating the global configurations for the server. To do so:
    1. Update the files in /config/ubuntu-16.04/global. Look for the 'newdjangosite' prompts for commonly changed values
    2. After updating, commit/push your changes and run fab deploy
    3. Run 'fab deploy_global_config:$deployment$'
    4. If PostgreSQL does not start after the update, a reboot may be needed
